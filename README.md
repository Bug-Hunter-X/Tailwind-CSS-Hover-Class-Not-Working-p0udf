# Tailwind CSS Hover Class Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS hover classes fail to apply. The expected behavior is that hovering over the div should change the background color. However, this does not happen due to a possible conflict or incorrect implementation.

## Bug

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple div with Tailwind CSS classes intended to change the background color on hover.  Despite seemingly correct syntax, the hover effect does not work. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the solution. This may include checks for CSS specificity conflicts, ensuring that the necessary Tailwind directives are correctly imported or that there are no conflicting styles overriding the Tailwind classes.
